INTRODUCTION
------------
Unmanaged Files module allows administrators to manage the unmanaged rather,
unused files. Module definitely makes use of managed files table and lists
down the unmanaged files from the public files folder recursively. This is a
great module to clean up the unused files and save some good disk space.


MODULE DETAILS
--------------
The module fetches the list of unmanaged/unused files in a properly managed
recursive directory structure.

Besides, the Module is packed with a handful of features that allows administrators to
manage the unused files carefully. It can look for references in WYSIWYG
fields prior to deletion.

Additionally, you can always execute a dry run before actual deletion to view
the files going to be deleted which give end-user a better grip over what
files do the user want to delete or exclude.


CONFIGURATION
